# Reproduce the results in the paper
    
## Install the environment
Requires python < 3.11
    
Using conda and pip (tested):
    
    conda create -n reproduce python==3.10
    conda activate reproduce
    conda install pip
    
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    
## Run everything in one script
Run the doit.sh script to download the audio data, run the experiments and produce the plots.

    sh doit.sh
    
which runs the commands

    # download the FSD dataset
    sh download_data.sh

    # run all the experiments (takes ~16h on a 2080Ti)
    sh run_experiments.sh

    # produce all the figures (takes ~5 min on a 2080Ti)
    python produce_figures.py --split=test --ray_root_dir=$(pwd)/ray_results/ --data_dir=$(pwd)/data/audio-mnist

The figures are stored in ./results/figures

    # figure 1 in paper
    data_example.pdf
    
    # figure 2 in paper
    test_time_frequency.pdf
    
    # figure 3 in paper
    test_audio_mnist.pdf

That should be all.

# More details
Some details on how to use the code.

## Download the Free Spoken Digits dataset
The Free Spoken Digits dataset can be downloaded using:

    sh download_data.sh
    
which will download the Free Spoken Digits dataset using the following commands:

    # DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.1342401
    wget https://zenodo.org/record/1342401/files/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset-v1.0.8.zip
    unzip free-spoken-digit-dataset-v1.0.8.zip
    mkdir data
    mv Jakobovski-free-spoken-digit-dataset-e9e1155/ data/audio-mnist
    rm free-spoken-digit-dataset-v1.0.8.zip

## Run experiments
An experiment is defined as a ray tune search space. The two search spaces presented in the paper are found in search_spaces.py, called audio_mnist and time_frequency. If you want to change the hyper parameter distribution simply modify the search space (e.g., https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api/search_space.html), or define another search space and update the appropriate line in main.py where the search space is loaded.

The experiments will not reproduce the exact results in the paper, the random seed has never been fixed, but the same trends should of the averages and standard deviations should be observed when re-running the experiments. (This has been verified a couple of times.)

Run all the experiments.

    sh run_experiments.sh

Only synthetic data.

    python main.py --num_samples=5 --max_epochs=10000 --name=time_frequency --ray_root_dir=$(pwd)/ray_results/ --data_dir=$(pwd)/data/audio-mnist
   
Only Free Spoken Digit dataset.

    python main.py --num_samples=5 --max_epochs=10000 --name=audio_mnist --ray_root_dir=$(pwd)/ray_results/ --data_dir=$(pwd)/data/audio-mnist
    
The code uses 0.33 GPUs and 2 CPUs per experiment, edit the tune.with_resources line in main.py if you want to use more or less GPUs or CPUs. Defaults to cuda:0 device.

All search spaces has been defined using 'grid_search' in ray tune. This means that the command --num_samples will define the number of times each configuration in the grid is run. If this is re-written using e.g. 'uniform' or other sampling commands from the search space api (https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api/search_space.html), then --num_samples will define the number of samples from that distribution.

## Produce figures

This re-produces all the figures in the paper.

Test data. This requires looping through all model configurations and making predictions on the test set, which takes a couple of minutes on the GPU. The DataFrame is stored in the ./results directory as well as the predictions and labels for each model, which are loaded the next time the script is run to prevent re-running all test predictions. If --split=valid is supplied no predictions need to be made, as the validation scores has already been computed during training for the early stopping criterion.

    # produces all figures in the paper
    python produce_figures.py --split=test --ray_root_dir=$(pwd)/ray_results/ --data_dir=$(pwd)/data/audio-mnist
    
Produces the figures used in the paper and puts them in the $(pwd)/results/figures directory.

## Explore the datasets and models

TODO: reference a notebook, and write a tutorial/guide in the notebook.
